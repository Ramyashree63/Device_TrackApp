# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43

# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/google_logo.png
    - assets/images/android_logo.png
    - assets/images/ios_logo.png
    - assets/images/splash.flr
    - assets/images/Teddy.flr
    - assets/images/ic_logout.png
    - assets/images/top_image_art.png
    - assets/images/top_image_art@2x.png
    - assets/images/top_image_art@3x.png
    - assets/images/ic_clock.png
    - assets/images/ic_mobile.png
    - assets/images/ic_refresh.png
    - assets/images/app_icon.png
#   - assets/images/top_image_art.png
#   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

    # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

    # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
    # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

    # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
    # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
    # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
    # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
    # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Gibson
      fonts:
      - asset: fonts/Gibson-Light.ttf
        weight: 300
      - asset: fonts/Gibson-Regular.ttf
        weight: 400
      - asset: fonts/Gibson-SemiBold.ttf
        weight: 700
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
